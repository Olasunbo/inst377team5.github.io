## Interactive Google Map Guide.

###### Key: Red pin = Specific library.



This dynamic Google Map API allows the user to see what libraries are within the Prince Georges County.

The user can drag areas of the map to get a better view by clicking
and dragging their mouse. This feature also allows the user to see
different counties, states, and even countries.

When the user is interested in a specific library location on the map
they can click on the red pin and it will show them the name and the
address.

By default the user is on the "map" view. They can reduce clutter by unchecking
the terrian box that appears when hovering over "map".

If they wish to see what the surrounding area of the library looks like they 
can switch the view to "satellite". This allows them to see exactly what the area 
looks like in real life. This is done through satellite imagery.
To further reduce clutter in the satellite view, the user can turn
off labels and have a better view.

In the top right hand corner of the map there is a full-screen option.

The Google API comes with a built in "terms of use" and "report a map error" 
that the user can use at thier own discresion.
