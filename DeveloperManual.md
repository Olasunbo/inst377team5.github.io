##Google API map for developers

The first step to developing with this API is creating an API key through 
Google. This API key is an indentifier that authenticates specific requests
associated with the users project. The reason for this is tracking usage and 
billing. You can do up to 25,000 searches per day for free.

Once the key is created, the developer will see a listed of numbers and 
characters associated with they key. This is the key that is linked in the 
JavaScript code.

This Google Map API allows developers to customize the map with their own
content. This includes images for specific pins for display on webpages 
or cell-phones and tablets. 

This JavaScript API uses four basic map types: Satellite, Roadmap, hybrid, 
and terrain. These can all be modified using styles and layers, controls and
events, and various services and libraries.

It is recommended to user a true DOCTYPE with your web application. This will allow
the website to be cross-browser compliant.
