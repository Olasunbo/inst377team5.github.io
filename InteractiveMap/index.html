    <li><h2>Google API Map</h2></li>
    
    <li>
    <p>The purpose of the interactive Google Map is so that users can see which libraries 
     are around them. The flag represent where the user in located. The 
    red pins are the location of libraries. </p></li>
    <li> <p>The map allows the user to zoom in and out and see the entire worlds if
        they want too. The view can be switched from Map to Satillite if the user
        wishes to see what the surroundings of the library are like. The API
        also provides a full-screen option.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p>This Map was created by using a free API offered by Google. To get
        permission to use it one must create a project in google cloud and then 
        create the key. The Appropriate API addon need to be downloaded too.
        Up to 25,0000 requests per day are free.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p>If the user wishes to see which library is represented, all they need to do
        is click on the pin and it will tell them the name and address of that library.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p>If given more time we would have liked to use are PG County library
        database to mark the library locations on the map. The issue is that we were
        not sure how to make this work. For the sake of this example, the 
        coordanites are hard coded with lattitude and longitude.
