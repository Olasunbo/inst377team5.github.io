#### Information Problem

Our mission is to help residents and students in Prince Georges County connect to 
libraries within the county. With our map they can see the exact location and 
address of the library and find the quickest route.

#### Stakeholders and Target Browser

The stakeholders are the children and adults of PG County. Our aim is to help students find 
libraries near them, but are website open to all residents for use. Residents, students, and 
visitors to PG County can all benefit from our service.

#### Data

We chose to work with the PG County Library Directory dataset. This listed every single library
in PG county with an address. We chose this dataset because it had current information on
all the libraries within the county. This would allow us to provide the most up to date information.

#### Solution

We created an interactive Google Map with the pinned location of certain libraries within the county.
The map allows users to zoom and change between four different map views to customize thier preferences.
We also wanted to make a search bar to search through the dataset, but ran into difficulties.

#### Reasoning

The dynamic map API allows the user to get a real sense of where the library is located and what is around them.
The API allowed for custimization on our end with coding coordinates and adding images for pins.

#### Does it help?

While our map help the user see what libraries are with the county and where they are located, it does not
have an integrated GPS that guide the user to that location. This would be necessary feature to maximize 
the effieciency of connecting residents and students to the library.

#### Challenges

We struggled with the back-end design and working with the data set. That was our greatest weakness. We
wanted to make a search bar that would allow the user to search through the library database and if a library 
was selected, that pin would be more bold then the others indicating the location. We didn't know how to integrate
a GPS feature to directly guide users to their library of choice.

#### Future

The possible future for our service would be to integrate GPS navigation in the app. This would put users on the
optimal route. In addition, their would be constant updates on routes to avoid in case of inclement weather. Another 
feature we would like to add is to let users schedule routes in advance. This would let them plan ahead during hectic
weeks. The GPS feature would be able to customize methods of transportation. This would include walking, driving, metro,
and public transportation. Given the proper data we would have like the have custom pins for all libraries with free
high speed internet.
